Overview of the Game:
The main idea of the game came from some clips of the game “SOMETHING BAD IS ON THE MOON” and from the horror movie “Apollo 18”. Both being that the moon is not a friendly place. You the player have goals or places you need to go and on your way monsters will try to lure you, sneak up to you or lead you a stray. In this demo the goal was to go collect a blackbox from an earlier expedition where on your way back you’d be followed by camouflaged monsters, boulder monsters.
The main parts of the game are:
•	Player – Astronaut, Moves with WASD, spacebar for jumping
•	Camera – Pivots around the head area with the mouse giving first person perspective
•	Blackbox by the crash site - It’s a blackbox like when planes crash suppose to tell the player some spooky and explain that they are not alone. Picked up by the crash site.
•	Enemies - Boulder monsters, spawns in after the player has picked up the blackbox and begins to walk towards the player and randomly stops to blend in with surrounding boulders.
•	Play field – moon surface filled with boulders scattered randomly around, crashsite and moonship to escape in
•	Lives – The player should have health to survive a few hits by the monster (wasn't implemented in time)
•	Sound - Should have had sounds... duh
Special features:
•	The monsters has colour and textures that helps them blend in with the background of the bright moon surface
•	The monsters inconsistent movement gives moments of “did I see that move?”
